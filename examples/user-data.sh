# The following script is an example using EC2 User Data to fetch and run the VKVMAgent binary on EC2 first run
# This example assumes an EC2 Instance Role has been configured along with an installation of the AWS CLI to enable
# access to the otherwise private S3 bucket.  The provided CDK pipeline example sets up an appropriate instance role
# and using an Amazon Linux EC2 image will result in the AWS CLI being available at boot time without additional steps.

# To prepare your script for use as userdata, run the equivalent to the following command in your environment:
# `cat userData.sh | base64`
# Capture the resulting string and update the InitData key in the example config map.

# NOTE Creating a service that will persist through reboots is OS-dependent and outside the scope of this example
