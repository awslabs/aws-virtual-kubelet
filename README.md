# AWS Virtual Kubelet
AWS Virtual Kubelet provides an extension to your [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster that can provision and maintain [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) based [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).  These EC2 pods can run arbitrary applications which might not otherwise fit into containers.

This expands the management capabilities of Kubernetes, enabling use-cases such as macOS native application lifecycle control via standard Kubernetes tooling.

## Architecture
A typical [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) Kubernetes (k8s) cluster is shown in the diagram below.  It consists of a k8s API layer, a number of _nodes_ which each run a `kubelet` process, and pods (one or more containerized apps) managed by those `kubelet` processes.

Using the [Virtual Kubelet library](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet), this EC2 provider implements a _virtual kubelet_ which looks like a typical `kubelet` to k8s.  API requests to create workload pods, etc. are received by the _virtual kubelet_ and passed to our custom EC2 provider.

This provider implements pod-handling endpoints using EC2 instances and an agent that runs on them.  The agent is responsible for launching and terminating "containers" (applications) and reporting status.  The provider â†” agent API contract is defined using the [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) spec and implemented via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).  This enables agents to be written in any support language and run on a variety of operating systems and architectures [^1].

Nodes are represented by [ENIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) that maintain a predictable IP address used for naming and consistent association of workload pods with _virtual kubelet_ instances.

## Prerequisites
The following are required to build and deploy this project.  Additional tools may be needed to utilize examples or set up a development environment.

### Go (lang)
Tested with [Go](https://golang.org) v1.12, 1.16, and 1.17.  See the [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install) for installation steps.

### Docker
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a container virtualization runtime.

See [Get Started](https://www.docker.com/get-started) in the docker documentation for setup steps.

### AWS account
The provider interacts directly with AWS APIs and launches EC2 instances so an AWS account is needed.  Click **Create an AWS Account** at https://aws.amazon.com/ to get started.

### AWS command line interface
Some commands utilize the AWS CLI.  See the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) page for installation and configuration instructions.

### Kubernetes cluster
EKS is _strongly_ recommended, though any k8s cluster with sufficient access to make AWS API calls and communicate over the network with gRPC agents _could_ work.

## Infrastructure QuickStart
To get the needed infrastructure up and running quickly, see the deploy [README](deploy/vkstack/README.md) which details using the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) Infrastructure-as-Code framework to automatically provision the required resources.

## Build
Once the required infrastructure is in place, follow the steps in this section to build the VK provider.

### Makefile
This project comes with a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction) to simplify build-related tasks.

Run `make` in this directory to get a list of subcommands and their description.

Some commands (such as `make push`) require appropriately set Environment Variables to function correctly.  Review variables at the top of the Makefile with `?=` and set in your shell/environment before running these commands.

1. Run `make build` to build the project.  This will also generate protobuf files and other generated files if needed.
2. Next run `make docker` to create a docker image with the `virtual-kubelet` binary.
3. Run `make push` to deploy the docker image to your [Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).

## Deploy
Now we're ready to deploy the VK provider using the steps outlined in this section.

Some commands below utilize the [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) tool to manage and configure k8s.  Other tools such as [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/index.html) may be used if desired (adapt instructions accordingly).

Example files that require updating placeholders with actual (environment-specific) data are copied to `./local` before modification.  The `local` directory's contents are ignored, which prevents accidental commits and _leaking_ account numbers, etc. into the GitHub repo.

### Cluster Role and Binding
The [ClusterRole](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole) and [Binding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#rolebinding-and-clusterrolebinding) give VK pods the necessary permissions to manage k8s workloads.

1. Run `kubectl apply -f deploy/vk-clusterrole_binding.yaml` to deploy the cluster role and binding.

### ConfigMap
The [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) provides global and default VK/VKP configuration elements.  Some of these settings may be overridden on a per-pod basis.

1. Copy the provided [examples/config-map.yaml](examples/config-map.yaml) to the `./local` dir and modify as-needed.  See [Config](docs/Config.md) for a detailed explanation of the various configuration options.

2. Next, run `kubectl apply -f local/config-map.yaml` to deploy the config map.

### StatefulSet
This configuration will deploy a set of VK providers using the docker image built and pushed earlier.

1. Copy the provided [examples/vk-statefulset.yaml](examples/vk-statefulset.yaml) file to `./local`.
2. Replace these placeholders in the `image:` reference with the values from your account/environment
   1. `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
   2. `AWS_REGION`
   3. `DOCKER_TAG`
3. Run `kubectl apply -f local/vk-statefulset.yaml` to deploy the VK provider pods.

## Usage
At this point you should have at least one running VK provider pod running successfully.  This section describes how to launch EC2-backed pods using the provider.

[examples/pods](examples/pods) contains both a single (unmanaged) pod example as well as a pod [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

1. Copy the desired pod example(s) to `./local`
    2. Run `kubectl apply -f <filename>` (replacing `<filename>` with the actual file name).

See the [Cookbook](docs/Cookbook.md) for more usage examples.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Why does this project exist?
This project serves as a translation and mediation layer between Kubernetes and EC2-based pods.  It was created in order to run custom workloads directly on any EC2 instance type/size available via AWS (e.g. [Mac Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/mac/)).

### How can I use it?
1. Follow the steps in this README to get all the infrastructure and requirements in place and working with the example agent.
2. Using the example agent as a guide, implement your own gRPC agent to support the desired workloads.
